âœ¨ I'm a Information System's student at UFMG (Brazil) and a junior software engineer. I love programming and learn new things everyday! Iâ€™m currently working on a project with NodeJS, React and MongoDB.

My goal is to become a better software engenieer everyday and be able to do what I love most, spend time with my family and coding.
